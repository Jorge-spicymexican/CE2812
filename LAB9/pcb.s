//What-is-the-difference-between-LDR-and-STR-Assembly-Language-instruction-of-ARM

	//LDR (Load Register): -move data into processor from memory. Loads a data
	//value to a specific register. Takes 2 arguements, one specifying the
	//register, other the location/address of the data value

	//Eg. LDR R1,[R2,#400] â†’ load data value at (R2+4*400) location to R1.
	//(multiplies by 4 assuming the memory is word-addressable)

	//STR(Store Register):- moves data out of the processor to memory locations
	//from a specified register. Takes 2 arguments, 1. register which value is
	//to be stored, 2. the memory location where value will be stored


	//push -  means writing it to the stack
	//pop - restoring whatever is on top of the stack into a register.

	//stacked the rest of the registers
	push {r4-r11,lr}

	//swap SP
	ldr r0, =task
	ldr r1,[r0, #8] // check which task is running
	subs r1, r1, #1
	beq 1f // If equal, 2nd task running

	// short branch if equals too
	// was task 0
	// store current SP to dseg
	str SP, [r0,#0] // the firs of r0 into the SP register
	// get other tasks SP
	ldr SP, [r0,#4] //load
	//set flag to task 1
	mov r1,#1
	str r1,[r0,#8]
	//done
	b finish

1: //was task 1
   //store current SP to desged
   str SP, [r0,#4]
   // get other task SP
   ldr SP, [r0,#0]
   // set flag to task 0
   mov r1,#0
